<blockquote>What is it? Everyone loves the Google CDN right? Even Microsoft runs their own CDN.  The problem is, they only host the most popular libraries.   We host the other stuff.</blockquote><div class="posterous_quote_citation">via <a href="http://www.cdnjs.com/">cdnjs.com</a></div><p>A CDN designed to cater for the <em>other</em> javascript libraries people use.</p><p>Cdnjs.com is a CDN governed by users/developers.  You can request a library to be added where it will be peer-reviewed and if successful, made available to all.</p><p>Looks to be a simple way to add functionality while developing as well as provide an easy deployment process, amongst all the other benefits CDNs offer.</p>
