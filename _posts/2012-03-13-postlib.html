I played around with <a href="https://posterous.com/">Posterous</a> some time ago (the old version of this blog used to be there).<br /><br /><a href="http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2158952/twitter-buys-posterous-blogging-business">Twitter recently acquired Posterous</a> and there has been some talk about it shutting down. &nbsp;Naturally some people would like to get their content out of the system sharp-ish but the latest API needs a key.<br /><br />I wrote PostLib ages ago when I was looking to process content from Posterous offline. &nbsp;I couldn't find the original project (but I had the debug version of the dll referenced in an old project). &nbsp;I've used Reflector to extract the source code and update it to .net 4.0 (it was 2.0). &nbsp;No promises on it's full capabilities or the quiality of code but it should help out <i>someone</i>. &nbsp;You&nbsp;can grab it from <a href="http://db.tt/9qyPaSoz">here</a><br /><br />It uses the old API so it may not be perfect, but it does seem to be responding with the expected content. &nbsp;Hopefully it'll help people out. &nbsp;You can use it by putting a reference to the project and then doing the following:<br /><br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/2028241.js?file=gistfile1.txt"></script>
