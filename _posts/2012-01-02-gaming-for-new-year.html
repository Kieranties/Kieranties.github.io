I'll admit, I'm a cheap gamer.<br /><br />It's not often I'll buy things brand spanking new. &nbsp;While I fully appreciate the time, effort and dedication it takes for a team of developers to create a gaming masterpiece, not <i>all</i>&nbsp;games <i>are</i>&nbsp;masterpieces. &nbsp;Game prices continue to soar and as a lowly (greedy) consumer I can't afford to buy all the games I want as soon as they are released. &nbsp;Nor do I always have the time I would like to dedicate to them!<br /><br />Some games offer a vast amount of playability e.g. Skyrim, some games offer far less e.g. Portal 2. &nbsp;Both these games are fantastic creations but I felt more comfortable handing over a healthy chunk of money buying Skyrim on release day than I did Portal 2. &nbsp;I love Portal 2, <i>absolutely love it, </i>for it's design, character and genius. &nbsp;But I couldn't justify £40+ for less then ten hours of gaming. &nbsp;Skyrim at 100+ hours is acceptable.<br /><br />So, being the cheap gamer that I am, I enjoy the January sales. &nbsp;There has been a recent trend in the high street game stores to offer less interesting deals on pre-owned games. &nbsp;Some old games such as Hitman and Oblivion have seen a price hike (I got Hitman for £2.50 2 years ago, today it was £7.99!). &nbsp;With Skyrim being released I assume interest in Oblivion has raised, hence the price change. &nbsp;But again, 2 years ago I purchased the GOTY edition for £9.99 brand new. &nbsp;Today the original release (no DLC) pre-owned was £17.99. &nbsp;Similar patterns can be observed with the Assassins Creed series, Call of Duty and many others.<br /><br />Two brief shopping sprees have left me with a nice pile of games to get through over the next few months. &nbsp;By the time I've finished this lot, Assassins Creed Revelations and a few others will have dropped in price!<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div><ul><li>Child Of Eden&nbsp;</li><li>Rage</li><li>Dead Rising 2</li><li>Far Cry 2</li><li>Crysis 2</li><li>Metro 2033</li><li>Ninety Nine Nights</li><li>Dark Souls</li><li>Splinter Cell: Double Agent</li></ul><br />Having just looked at the pile under the table I realise I still have this lot to start or play through properly!<br /><br /><ul><li>Skyrim - The missus is currently playing this</li><li>Fable 2 - Which will undoubtedly lead to buying Fable 3</li><li>Halo 3 - All the Halo love seems to of skipped me by.</li><li>Left For Dead</li><li>Left For Dead 2 - I've only been playing multiplayer with these!</li><li>Star Wars: The Force Unleashed &nbsp;- With which I suffered a rather annoying bug where I need to restart my game!</li></ul><br />I'll check back at the end of the year and see how many I got through!<br /><br />
