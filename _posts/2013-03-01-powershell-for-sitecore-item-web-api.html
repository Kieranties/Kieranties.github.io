My colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/adamsimsy"
    target="_blank">Adam Simmonds</a> did a demo of the Sitecore Item Web API at work based on the <a href="https://github.com/herskinduk/Usergroup.ItemWebApi"
    target="_blank">code</a> provided by <a href="https://twitter.com/herskinduk" target="_blank">Kern Herskind</a> from a recent
Sitecore User Group. &nbsp;It was great to see a small, simple, yet powerful API available to mobile solutions and third-party
services that could operate in a RESTful way.<br /><br />The ability to drop into a solution with very minor configuration
changes makes the API incredibly simple to apply to existing solutions (if the Sitecore version is supported of course).&nbsp;
It also follows Sitecore's principle design of pipelines and security; making it really easy to extend with custom functionality
or handlers while also restricting requests at a user level using the security domain set for the website. &nbsp;This means
full control of security restrictions can be applied using the standard Sitecore security model and interface.<br /><br />In
short, it’s pretty damn awesome.<br /><br />
<h4>Now with added PowerShell</h4><br />On Tuesday evening I knocked up a quick module to send requests to a site running the
API. &nbsp;Yesterday I cleaned it up, improved documentation, and packaged with a proper manifest.<br /><br />I’m not entirely
happy with the state of the code but it is now much more usable and in a better state to extend and (hopefully) be useful
to others. &nbsp;I'm still learning PowerShell and need to work out a coding style and development process that works for
me.<br /><br />
<h4>Usage</h4><br />The module&nbsp;implements&nbsp;a small handful of commands:<br />
<ul>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Add-SitecoreItem</span>&nbsp;– Creates a new Sitecore item,
        optionally setting fields</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Get-SitecoreItem</span>&nbsp;– Gets one or more Sitecore
        items which match the context of the given parameters</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Remove-SitecoreItem</span>&nbsp;– Deletes one or more Sitecore
        items based on the context</li>
    <li><span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Set-SitecoreItem</span>&nbsp;– Updates the fields of one
        or more Sitecore items</li>
</ul>There is an additional&nbsp;<span style="font-family: Courier New, Courier, monospace;">Invoke-SitecoreRequest</span>&nbsp;method
which is a special “bare bones” function &nbsp;to allow extended control of the parameters passed to Sitecore.&nbsp; All
other functions act as wrappers to this function, providing validation and parameter restrictions where possible.<br /><br
/>Aside from making it simple to perform CRUD actions with Sitecore &nbsp;(think bulk uploads, change properties, quick reports
etc) I hope to use this to perform some level of integration testing. <br /><br />I'm currently spending a lot of time investigating
(and improving!) build processes. &nbsp;With the aim of making the transition of code from Dev -&gt; Stage -&gt; Live as
seamless and&nbsp;<i>robust</i>&nbsp;as possible. &nbsp;Increasing the robustness involves validating that packages and items
have been deployed properly. &nbsp;This looks like it may be a useful tool to perform validation of fields that have been
updated.<br /><br />
<h4>Download and Install</h4>
<div><br /></div>All the information you need is available at the <a href="https://github.com/Kieranties/PSSitecoreItemWebApi"
    target="_blank">Github repo</a>.<br /><br />If you don't have the Sitecore Item Web API installed already you can download
the API and documentation from <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=4&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CEgQFjAD&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fsdn.sitecore.net%2FSDN5%2FProducts%2FSitecore%2520Item%2520Web%2520API%2FSitecoreItemWebApi10.aspx&amp;ei=ytsvUaP8BuPE0QWG5IHIAQ&amp;usg=AFQjCNGgG2v33aikFY8lPxf4MXf2CLUlZA&amp;bvm=bv.43148975,d.d2k"
    target="_blank">Sitecore</a>&nbsp;(You'll need an SDN login).<br /><br />
<h4>Examples</h4><br /><em>For demo purposes the account used here is an admin.&nbsp; To restrict access, use Sitecore roles and the configuration options in the Sitecore Item Web API config include.</em><br
/>
<h5>Getting an item</h5>
<script async src="https://gist.github.com/Kieranties/5059684.js?file=Get-SitecoreItem.ps1"></script> <br />
<h5>Adding an item</h5>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kieranties/5059684.js?file=Add-SitecoreItem.ps1"></script> <br />
<h5>Setting an item</h5>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kieranties/5059684.js?file=Set-SitecoreItem.ps1"></script> <br />
<h5>Removing an item</h5>
<script src="https://gist.github.com/Kieranties/5059684.js?file=Remove-SitecoreItem.ps1"></script> <br />
<h4>Further Work</h4>
<ol>
    <li>Tests - seriously, if I want to use this for testing and building I’m going to need a decent test suite to know things
        are working as expected.&nbsp; This will also give me a chance to get to grips with <a href="https://github.com/pester/Pester"
            target="_blank">Pester</a>. </li>
    <li>Additional functions – RSA encryption and the ability to upload media are next on the list </li>
    <li>Pipelining – PowerShell functions are even more useful when you chain them together.&nbsp; It would be great to run something
        like: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Import-Csv input.csv | Add-SitecoreItem mydomain –user username –pass password | select –expand Items | select DisplayName,ID,Path,Version | Export-Csv output.csv</span>        (which would read a csv, create new items based on each row then output the new item details to another csv </li>
    <li>Code structure – I don’t like everything being one big file.&nbsp; I’d like to break things into smaller chunks and related
        modules.&nbsp; </li>
    <li>Session based access – It’s a bit tedious adding the domain, username and password to every request.&nbsp; While requests
        are stateless a PowerShell session&nbsp;needn't&nbsp;be.&nbsp; Something like: <span style="font-family: courier new, courier, monospace;">Start-SitecoreSession domain username password -encrypt –params @{ path = “/sitecore/content/home” }</span>        could set session level variables that can be used by methods.&nbsp; This is extended to cater for parameters which
        could apply to every call (while overriding at a function level) and also be a good place to perform encryption duties.
        </li>
    <li>Aliases - For parameters as well as functions. &nbsp;The breadth of parameters available to the functions make it tedious
        to type long form when you just want to type in the command line.</li>
    <li>Response formatting - I've done a small amount of work to normalise the formatting of the different responses the API
        provides. &nbsp;However the response format of the Fields property is a little awkward. &nbsp;It would be better
        if this was an array of fields rather then a hash with guid based keys.</li>
</ol>
<div>Hopefully this little module will be of use to others. &nbsp;If you've taken a look and have any suggestions or improvements
    (or bugs!) let me know ;-)</div>
