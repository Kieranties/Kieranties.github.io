During the last six months of 2011 I began picking up and reading more tech books then I think I had in the previous 3 years. <br /><div><br /></div><div>My interest in Javascript increased as I started playing around with<a href="http://nodejs.org/"> Node.js</a>, creating <a href="http://code.google.com/chrome/extensions/docs.html">Google Chrome Extensions</a> and in general trying to&nbsp;(hopefully)&nbsp;make myself a better dev. I then went back-to-basics and began looking at TDD before reading up and playing around with some of the&nbsp;loveliness&nbsp;that is HTML5.</div><div><br /></div><div>I read through (and highly recommend):</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML5-Up-Running-Mark-Pilgrim/dp/0596806027">Dive Into HTML5</a> - Mark Pilgrim</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Art-Unit-Testing-Examples-NET/dp/1933988274/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752760&amp;sr=1-1">The Art of Unit Testing</a> - Roy Osherove</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Patterns-Stoyan-Stefanov/dp/0596806752/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752777&amp;sr=1-1">Javascript Patterns</a> - Stoyan Stefanov</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752790&amp;sr=1-1">Javascript: The Good Parts</a> - Douglas Crockford</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/JavaScript-Web-Applications-Alex-MacCaw/dp/144930351X/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752809&amp;sr=1-1">Javascript Web Applications</a> - Alex McCaw</li><li><a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Hands-on-Node-js-ebook/dp/B004ZURMXY/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752926&amp;sr=1-1">Hand-on Node.js</a> - Pedro Teixeira</li></ul><div>I'm not one for making new years resolutions, but I'd like to keep up my tech reading with at least one book a month (dependant on size of course). &nbsp;I get at least 1-2 hours of reading time a day commuting to and from work. &nbsp;I find reading in the morning helps me get my brain up and running, reading on the way home helps me switch off from "work mode".</div></div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not looking to pick up any new languages, but anything that demonstrates a new way of thinking, developments in .Net/Javascript/Node/HTML or toolkits which make life easier or more fulfilling for a developer would be of great interest.</div><div><br /></div><div>I'm not restricting myself completely to physical books. &nbsp;I do have a Kindle which allows me to make use of the wonderful <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ipkfnchcgalnafehpglfbommidgmalan">Send to Kindle</a> extension and <a href="http://manual.calibre-ebook.com/news.html#completely-automatic-fetching">Calibres fantastic RSS support</a> to read web content that hasn't been published in either physical or ebook format.</div><div><br /></div><div>My to-read list currently looks like:</div><div><ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_Control">Castle/IoC</a> - I still consider myself a newbie with this. &nbsp;There's plenty I do know, but not concrete enough to start from scratch without a reference at every step.</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-Relational_Mapping">NHibernate/ORMs</a> - I've toyed a little with <a href="http://nhforge.org/Default.aspx">NHibernate</a> but again would like to get more knowledge in my head.</li><li><a href="http://nodejs.org/">Node.js</a> - I'm really enjoying tinkering with Node, it's time to make something a bit more complete and fully featured!</li><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nosql">NoSQL</a> - I've done some work with <a href="http://couchdb.apache.org/">CouchDb</a> but would like to see what other systems are on offer and how they fair. &nbsp;A better understanding would also be appreciated when it comes to the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/">IndexedDb API</a>&nbsp;in HTML5</li><li><a href="http://www.android.com/">Android </a>- I have an Android <a href="http://www.samsung.com/uk/galaxys2/">phone</a> (and soon a shiny new <a href="http://eee.asus.com/en/eeepad/transformer/features/">tab</a>) plus I am duty bound to deliver something to the inimitable <a href="http://twitter.com/stringfellow">@stringfellow</a> that I have already started.</li></ul></div><div>Finally I have just begun&nbsp;<a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/20-Recipes-Programming-MVC-Development/dp/1449309860/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1325752883&amp;sr=1-1">20 Recipes for Programming MVC3</a> by Jamie Munro, so I'm sorted for this month.</div><div><br /></div><div>If you've got a suggestion, I'd love to hear it.</div><div><br /></div><div>(I've also signed up for the <a href="http://www.saas-class.org/">Software Engineering for Software as a Service</a> course by Berkeley University, and <a href="http://codyyear.com/">CodyYear.com</a>&nbsp;by <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/#!/exercises/0">Codecademy</a>&nbsp;both are free and look excellent.)</div>
