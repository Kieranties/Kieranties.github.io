It looks to be an interesting project involving some data migration, custom reporting and a simple front end.<br /><br />The weekend is set to be a busy, highly focussed, caffeine-swilling, sleep-depriving flurry of development, but I'm confident we'll be able to produce something that hits the target.<br /><br /><a href="https://twitter.com/#!/Kieranties/status/126658064173633539">https://twitter.com/#!/Kieranties/status/126658064173633539</a>The event is being organised by <a href="http://twitter.com/stack72">Paul Stack</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/rachelhawley">Rachel Hawley</a> who have both done a fantastic job in gathering a host of people from around the UK to attend the event.<br /><br />Tomorrow the fun begins!
